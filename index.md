## Introduction

The Resistance is a multi-player deductive reasoning role-playing game designed by Don Eskridge in 2010. The players are divided into two "factions": the resistance (the "good guys") and the government spies (the "bad guys"). Within the game, players are sent on 5 missions that can either pass or fail. The resistance players aim to pass a majority of these missions, while the government spies aim to sabotage the missions. A minimum of five players are required for the game. 

At the start of a game with five players, two players are chosen at random to be spies and the other three players are the resistance. The spies know each other's identity while the resistance remains in the dark. At the start of each round, a Mission Leader is chosen who will guide the round's mission. The Mission Leader selectes a team to send on the mission, after which everyone votes on the team make-up. If the players agree, the team is sent on the mission. If the players disagree, a new player becomes the Mission Leader and the process repeats. After 5 failed attempts to create a mission team, the government spies automatically win that mission and recieve a point. 

In a mission, each person on the team place a card face-down, either a "pass"-card or a "fail"-card. Resitance players must play a "pass"-card, while spies can choose to play a "pass"-card or a "fail"-card. The resistance wins the mission if all cards played are "pass"-cards, while the spies win if at least one card played is a "fail"-card. Winning the mission gives the respective faction a point. A faction wins the game once they have received three points.

Resistance players have to try to deduce who the spies are to ensure that the spies cannot sabotage the missions. The spies have to attempt to keep their identity a secret from the resistance.

For our project, we are going to implement a multi-agent simulation based on the Resistance. We will be using higher-order knowledge and public announcements. Since the game can be rather complex, we will consider a simplified version. *insert simplifications later* Spies only play "fail"-cards ?


## Model 
We are going to model the Resistance game with the help of Dynamic Epistemic Logic. With five players we have a set of five agents A = {1,2,3,4,5}. Out of these agents, two agents are spies which we can denote by s_i meaning that agent i is a spy. The worlds of the Kripke model will consist of every combination of spy pairs, resulting in 10 initial worlds. The initial model is shown below. 

*insert initial model image here*

As the game proceeds, the model is simplified as the agents learn from the public annoucements given at the end of each misssion.
